#Imagine you're a teacher who needs to send a message to each of your students reminding them of their missing assignments and grade in the class. You have each of their names, number of missing assignments, and grades on a spreadsheet and just have to insert them into placeholders in this message you came up with:

#message to print to the student
#Hi [insert student name],

#This is a reminder that you have [insert number of missing assignments] assignments left to submit before you can graduate. Your current grade is [insert current grade] and can increase to [insert potential grade] if you submit all assignments before the due date.
